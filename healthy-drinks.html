        Herbal tea, also known as tisane, is a beloved beverage enjoyed by many 
        for its soothing and healing properties. Unlike true teas, which are derived 
        from the Camellia sinensis plant, herbal teas are made from a variety of dried 
        herbs, flowers, fruits, and spices. Renowned for their delightful
         flavors and potential health benefits, herbal teas have been cherished          for centuries in various cultures worldwide.
      One of the most captivating aspects of herbal tea is its diverse array 
      of flavors and aromas. Each herbal infusion offers a unique taste profile,
        ranging from delicate and floral to robust and spicy. Popular herbs used
      in herbal teas include chamomile, peppermint, lavender, hibiscus, rooibos, 
      and lemon balm, among many others. With such a rich palette of natural 
      ingredients, herbal teas provide a delightful alternative to traditional
       caffeinated beverages.
